# Fractal Images

A C++ project for generating and visualizing fractal images such as the Mandelbrot and Julia sets, featuring ASCII and PPM output support, multithreading capabilities, and a GUI built with GLUT.

---

## Features

- Mandelbrot and Julia set fractal generation
- ASCII and image-based (PPM) rendering output
- Interactive terminal-based menu system
- Multithreaded image generation for performance
- GUI-based viewer with GLUT for real-time visualization
- Modular code design with separate logic for rendering, I/O, and image processing

---

## Technologies Used

- **C++** with object-oriented architecture
- **OpenGL / GLUT** for GUI rendering
- **PPM** for raw image output
- **Makefiles** for easy build management
- **Multithreading** support in fractal computations
